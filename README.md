#  Superstore Sales Dashboard - Power BI Project

##  Project Overview
A comprehensive business intelligence solution built in Power BI analyzing sales, customer behavior, and product performance for a retail superstore.

##  Dataset
- **Source:** Superstore Sales Dataset (Kaggle)
- **Records:** 9,994 orders
- **Time Period:** 2014-2017
- **Data Points:** Sales, Profit, Discounts, Customer segments, Geographic data

##  Skills Achieved

### 1. ETL & Data Cleaning (Power Query)
- Cleaned null values and standardized formats
- Split Customer Name into First/Last names
- Created calculated columns (Year, Month, Quarter, Delivery Days)
- Flagged profit outliers
- Removed duplicates

### 2. Data Modeling
- Built star schema with:
  - **1 Fact Table:** Sample - Superstore
  - **4 Dimension Tables:** DimCustomer, DimProduct, DimRegion, DimDate
- Established proper Many-to-One relationships
- Created separate measures table for DAX calculations

### 3. DAX Calculations
Created 10+ advanced measures including:
- Total Sales, Total Profit, Total Orders
- Profit Margin = `DIVIDE([Total Profit], [Total Sales])`
- Sales YoY Growth
- Average Delivery Days
- RFM Segmentation (Recency, Frequency, Monetary analysis)
- Customer segmentation logic

### 4. Interactive Dashboards

##  Key Insights
- Technology category drives the highest sales (approximately $0.4M).
- Consumer segment contributes over 50% of total sales.
- Higher discount rates are strongly linked to lower or negative profit margins.
- A small group of loyal customers (RFM Champions) accounts for a significant share of revenue.
- West region leads in overall sales performance across all regions.
- Top 10 customers alone contribute a noticeably large portion of total revenue.
